Requirements:
- useState (used to save data from API)
- useEffect (used to properly get data from an API)
- react-router-dom (2 pages minimum)
- (can use others, of course)
- ReadME.MD
- multiple commits 12 - 15 commits
- get & display information from API
- creativity is 5%
- must solve a problem. Real or Fictional
- must use async/await
- can use Axios or Fetch


Current Status:
 - API axios GET & display (done)
 - useState and useEffect (done)
 - 2 pages (done, sort of - data passing, but still ugly and clunky)
 - Lots to clean up
 - what problem am I solving? umm... novel ways to choose a movie?

 Frustration:
 - this is not the project I set out to do! I was building something with the setlist.fm API (music/live show database), tested it out and everything. Then when I tried to do it as front-end/React App (as oppose to node/express) I ran into CORS issues that I couldn't seem to circumnavigate. So I had to burn it down and start form scratch. *stressful sigh*
